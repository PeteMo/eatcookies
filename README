Name: 
    eatcookies

Description: 
    eatcookies implements a cookie whitelist for the Chromium web browser.
Sites are added to the whitelist by editing the `whitelist' array in the
script.  The `%' character acts as a wildcard.

Usage: 
    eatcookies can be run at any time to remove all cookies not on the
whitelist.  Another option is to call chromium via a wrapper script that calls
eatcookies when the browser exits cleanly.  See chromium-launcher for an
example.

Dependencies:
    sqlite3 - http://www.sqlite.org/
